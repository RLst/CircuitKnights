Step by step walkthrough

//// LEGEND
K = kinematic
RB = rigidbody
T = trigger
C = collider
=> jointed

/// BEFORE
Lance = KRB
Shield = KTRB
Horse = KRB     //RB so that the player can be jointed to it
Player.Bodies[] = KTRB
Player.Spine/Pelvis => Horse with breakable force being adjusted depending on health?

/// DURING
If Player.Lance collides with ColliderOnLayer(Opponent).Anything
{
    //Player
    Player.Lance = RB

    //Opponent
    Opponent.Body[] = RB
    Opponent.Animator.SetActive(false)
    Opponent.Lance = RB
    Opponent.Shield = RB    
}

Get collision data
Vector3 collisionPoint = collision.contacts[0].point

Opponent lerps blends back to idle animation after a certain period of time, based on collision impact. 
The greater, the more recovery time required.

/// AFTER
Player = RB + Ragdoll; SetParent(null); 
Lance = RB => Player.RightHand/Arm
Shield = RB => Player.LeftHand/Arm
Horse = KRB
