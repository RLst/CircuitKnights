# CircuitKnights

Play as a robot knight in a poor replication of a medieval joust. In this vertical split-screen, local multiplayer game, you will try to strike damaging blows to your opponent. The character will ride a robot horse, which will continuously travel around a track until either player falls off. 

The player will have control over three aspects of gameplay; the lance, the speed of the horse and the shield. The lance will be the main challenge to overcome - once the horse starts charging you will only have a few seconds to try and aim it. The player will also have to account for its natural sway from how fast the horse is moving. In order to minimise this sway, you can try to time the first boost of your horse to start at the perfect time during the countdown.

The robots can lose their heads and their non-dominant arm if they are hit. Losing the head will make aiming your lance harder, and losing the arm will make protecting yourself more difficult as you no longer will have a shield. The UI will not have any health bars or numbers flying out of each hit, instead the player will know the health of the opponent through visual cues such as how the opponent looks.

When the robotâ€™s health is at 0, they will be knocked off their horse and the round will be over. The robot will become a ragdoll and you will see the hit in slow motion. Players can pick how many rounds need to be won in order to win the whole tournament (eg. First to three wins).
